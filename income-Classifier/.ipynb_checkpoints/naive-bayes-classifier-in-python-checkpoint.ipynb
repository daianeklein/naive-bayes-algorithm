    "4.\tROC AUC of our model approaches towards 1. So, we can conclude that our classifier does a very good job in predicting whether a person makes over 50K a year.\n",
    "5.\tUsing the mean cross-validation, we can conclude that we expect the model to be around 80.63% accurate on average.\n",
    "6.\tIf we look at all the 10 scores produced by the 10-fold cross-validation, we can also conclude that there is a relatively small variance in the accuracy between folds, ranging from 81.35% accuracy to 79.64% accuracy. So, we can conclude that the model is independent of the particular folds used for training.\n",
    "7.\tOur original model accuracy is 0.8083, but the mean cross-validation accuracy is 0.8063. So, the 10-fold cross-validation accuracy does not result in performance improvement for this model."
